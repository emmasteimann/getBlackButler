Black Butler Downloader
=========

Purpose....
-----------
I made my original comic downloader for Scary Go Round, but then I wondered if I could expand it to my other favorite web comics and even some mangas, so I've now expanded it to [Black Butler](http://www.mangareader.net/102/kuroshitsuji.html).

Each chapter is loaded into its own `.cbz` file. Which can be used with most comic readers. For Mac, see [Simple Comic](http://dancingtortoise.com/simplecomic/) or [Jomic](http://jomic.sourceforge.net/).

How to use...
-----------
A downloader tool for my favorite webcomic.

  - Run `bundle`
  - Run `bundle exec ruby get_black_butler.rb`
  - Enjoy all of Black Butler!

What this does....
-----------

This downloads the entirety of Black Butler from Manga Readers website.
